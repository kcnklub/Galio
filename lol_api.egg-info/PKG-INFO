Description: ï»¿# lol-api.py
        Lol-api is a light wrapper for the Riot Games, League of Legends API. I built this for a learn project and for a future project that I plan on working on. I used Darquiche's project as inspiration for this. Check out his project [here](https://github.com/Darquiche/Riot-Observer).
        
        ## Installation
        ```
        pip install lol-api
        ```

        ## Examples
        ```python
        from LolApi import LolApi
        from LolApi import LolException
        
        x = LolApi('your-api-key')
        ```
        ### Summoner API
        You can get summoner information by name, id, and AccountId
        ```python
        summoner = x.get_summoner_by_name('summoner-id')
        ```
        ### Champion API
        The champion API allows you to call for all champions or get a certain champion by id or free to play champions.
        ```python
        all_champions = x.get_all_champions()
        FTP_champions = x.get_all_champions(free_to_play=True)
        ekko = x.get_champion_by_id(245)
        ```
        ### Spectator API
        This is used for getting Active games of players by id and Featured games. 
        ```python
        active_match = x.get_active_game_info_by_summoner_id(summoner-id)
        featured_games = x.get_featured_games()
        ```
        ### Match API
        You are able to get recent match history, ranked match history, match details, and match timelines from this API
        ```
        match = x.get_match_by_id(match-id)
        ranked_match_history = x.get_ranked_matchlist(account-id)
        recent_match_history = x.get_recent_matchlist(account-id)
        match_timeline = x.get_match_timeline(match-id)
        ```
        ### Champion Mastery API
        Information about champion mastery based on account and champion.
        ```
        champion_mastery_list = x.get_champion_mastery_by_summoner_id(summoner-id)
        champion_mastery_champion = x.get_champion_mastery_by_summoner_id_and_champion_id(summoner-id, champion-id)
        total_mastery = x.get_total_mastery_score(summoner-id)
        ```
        ### League API
        Get ranked information
        ```
        challenger = x.get_challenger_league()
        master = x.get_master_league()
        summoner_league_information = x.get_league_by_summoner_id(summoner-id)
        ladder_pos = x.get_ladder_position(summoner-id)
        ```
        ### Static Information
        Get static data about the game. Every call in the Riot's API is included since there is so many I am not going to write them out here, and the use of ddragon isn't used. Take a look in source. 
        ### Masteries
        Get the mastery information of a summoner
        ```
        masteries = x.get_masteries_by_summoner_id(summoner-id)
        ```
        ### Runes
        Get the rune information of a summoner
        ```
        runes = x.get_rune_pages_by_summoner_id(summoner-id)
        ```
